This repository contains code for several analysis related to:

Diet unmasks genetic variants that regulate lifespan in outbred Drosophila
L Pallares*, AJ Lea*, et al.
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.346312v2

Specifically, the analyses that are described here are:

1) Using a beta binomial model to test for allele frequency differences between t0 and tN in each environment
2) Estimating the allele frequency change between t0 and tN from model coefficents
3) Simulating data to be analyzed using a beta binomial vs CMH approach
4) Testing to see if lifespan associated SNPs followed particular trajectories hypothesized by different theories of aging
